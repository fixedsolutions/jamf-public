These are files I created and worked on during a contract for the Social Security Administration.

DISCLAIMERS:
- I don't claim that everything is perfect; there are some working/scratch files in here that I haven't cleaned up or removed.
- Some scripts won't work off the SSA internal network.
- Some portions were lifted from elsewhere, but I give credit/links when applicable.
- Feel free to repurpose anything in here if the spirit moves you.
